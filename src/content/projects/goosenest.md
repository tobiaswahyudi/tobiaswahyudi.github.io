#What is it?
GooseNet acts as a community for an apartment building where people can chat freely and anonymously in group chats. There can be different groups or communities available (i.e. lunch group, lending group, basketball community). People can also make posts where other people can comment freely without having to reveal their identity. Our platform will have a great deal of anonymity attached to it, creating a safe space for every single one of our users.

We used Google's Firebase to store the posts and chats within a group for our backend. For our Frontend, we used Next.JS React to create chat screens, threads and posts, as well as maintenance requests. We used SurveyMonkey's API to power our maintenance request feature as well as collecting tenant feedback. We simply used a mobile-optimized WebView of our website for the Android app.

This was my first ever hackathon, and I really enjoyed it. Check out the project on [devpost](https://devpost.com/software/goosenet-an-anonymous-community-for-your-apartment)!

##Where did the idea come from?
The inspiration comes from the times when we start our co-op terms and move to completely new places. It can be very isolating because you have no one to talk to, even from your own building. That's why we decided to make a social media platform dedicated to building communities in residential spaces - for people to socialize and meet up with each other. In addition, we can become a supportive community by helping your neighbours with small things, like lending them a vacuum cleaner!
